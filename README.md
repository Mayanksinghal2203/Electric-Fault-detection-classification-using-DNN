# Electric-Fault-detection-classification-using-DNN
This project implements an end-to-end Deep Learning pipeline for detecting and classifying electrical faults based on voltage and current sensor data. The goal is to build a professional and accurate model capable of identifying six types of electrical faults, as well as detecting when there is no fault.
